# Rancid Tomatillos - A Movie Application

## Abstract
Rancid Tomatillos is an app used to view the average ratings of a variety of films, and also looking more deeply at each film's details. Users can search through the films in the database by title or by a selected range of average rating. Based on these search parameters the user will see an assortment of movie poster thumbnails on the homepage. By clicking a thumbnail the user navigates to the individual film page to see more details and a carousel of related youtube videos.
